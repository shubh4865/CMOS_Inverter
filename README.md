# CMOS_INVERTER
The project titled "CMOS Inverter Design Using Cadence Virtuoso" involves the design and analysis of a CMOS inverter using the Cadence Virtuoso tool and a gpdk180nm technology library. Below is a summary of the project's key aspects:
# Project Description:
A CMOS inverter is a fundamental logic gate in digital electronics that performs the NOT function, inverting the input signal. The design of this inverter is implemented using the Cadence Virtuoso design tool, which allows for the creation, simulation, and analysis of the CMOS inverter at the transistor level.

Key Components and Structure:

1. PMOS (P-channel MOSFET): Connected to the power supply (VDD).
2. NMOS (N-channel MOSFET): Connected to ground (VSS).
3. Operation: The transistors are connected in series with their gates receiving the same input signal. Depending on the input voltage, either the PMOS or NMOS transistor conducts, resulting in the output being pulled to VDD (logic 1) or ground (logic 0).

# Simulations Performed:
1. DC Analysis: To observe voltage transfer characteristics and transistor operation regions.
2. Transient Analysis: To simulate dynamic behavior over time.
3. Switching Threshold Analysis: To determine the midpoint voltage for proper transistor sizing.
4. Rise Time & Fall Time Analysis: To ensure equal rise and fall times for efficient switching.
5. Noise Margin Calculation: To measure the tolerance to noise for stable operation.

# Conclusion:
The project successfully demonstrates the design and simulation of a CMOS inverter, including key parameters like noise margins, propagation delay, and dynamic performance. The transistor sizing was optimized based on switching threshold and rise/fall time analyses, ensuring efficient and reliable circuit operation.

The design methodology and simulation results validate the functionality of the CMOS inverter, making it a fundamental component in various digital electronic devices and circuits.
